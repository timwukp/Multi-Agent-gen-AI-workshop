# Security Monitoring Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive security and compliance monitoring for the AWS Bedrock Workshop multi-agent system. This implementation covers all requirements from task 9 of the advanced-tools-and-observability specification.

## Components Implemented

### 1. SecurityMonitor Class (`src/observability/security.py`)

**Core Features:**
- Authentication and authorization event logging
- Data access tracking with sensitivity classification
- Audit trail generation with user attribution and timestamps
- Security alert management
- Automated anomaly detection
- Multi-framework compliance reporting
- Input sanitization and security validation

**Key Methods:**
- `log_authentication_event()` - Logs successful/failed authentication attempts
- `log_authorization_event()` - Logs authorization decisions
- `log_data_access_event()` - Tracks data access with sensitivity levels
- `create_audit_trail()` - Creates comprehensive audit records
- `log_security_alert()` - Manages security alerts and notifications
- `detect_anomalies()` - Automated anomaly detection
- `generate_compliance_report()` - Multi-framework compliance reporting

**Security Features:**
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Automatic anomaly detection for suspicious patterns
- CloudWatch Logs integration with proper retention policies
- SNS notifications for high-severity events
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. SecurityDashboardService Class (`src/observability/security_dashboards.py`)

**Dashboard Types:**
- **Security Overview Dashboard** - Real-time security event monitoring
- **Compliance Dashboard** - Multi-framework compliance tracking
- **Anomaly Detection Dashboard** - Security anomaly visualization

**CloudWatch Alarms:**
- High severity security events alarm
- Failed authentication attempts alarm
- Low compliance score alarm
- Security anomaly detection alarm

### 3. Data Models

**SecurityEvent:**
- Comprehensive event tracking with metadata
- Security level classification (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- Compliance framework mapping
- Trace correlation support

**AuditTrail:**
- User attribution with timestamps
- Before/after value tracking
- Resource type classification
- Compliance framework association

**SecurityAnomaly:**
- Anomaly type classification
- Confidence scoring (0.0 to 1.0)
- Mitigation action recommendations
- Affected user/resource tracking

**ComplianceReport:**
- Multi-framework support (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO27001)
- Violation tracking and analysis
- Compliance score calculation
- Automated recommendations

### 4. Compliance Framework Support

**SOC 2:**
- Authentication logging validation
- Authorization event correlation
- Insufficient logging detection

**GDPR:**
- Sensitive data access consent tracking
- Data retention compliance monitoring
- Privacy violation detection

**HIPAA:**
- PHI access audit trail validation
- Healthcare data protection monitoring

**ISO 27001:**
- Security incident response tracking
- Information security management compliance

### 5. Anomaly Detection

**Automated Detection Patterns:**
- Excessive failed authentication attempts (threshold: 5 per hour)
- Suspicious IP activity (threshold: 10 requests per minute)
- Privilege escalation patterns (threshold: 3 changes per day)
- Unusual access patterns (threshold: 20+ resources per day)

**Anomaly Response:**
- Automatic security alert generation
- Mitigation action recommendations
- Confidence scoring for accuracy
- Integration with monitoring dashboards

## Integration Points

### ObservabilityService Integration
- Seamless integration with existing observability infrastructure
- Metrics collection for security events
- Trace correlation for security incidents
- Health monitoring integration

### CloudWatch Integration
- Structured logging to dedicated log groups
- Custom metrics for security monitoring
- Dashboard creation and management
- Automated alerting via SNS

### AWS Services Used
- **CloudWatch Logs** - Centralized security event logging
- **CloudWatch Metrics** - Security metrics collection
- **CloudWatch Dashboards** - Visual monitoring interfaces
- **CloudWatch Alarms** - Automated alerting
- **SNS** - Alert notifications
- **CloudTrail** - AWS API audit integration

## Usage Examples

### Basic Security Event Logging
```python
from src.observability.security import create_security_monitor
from src.observability.config import create_observability_config

config = create_observability_config()
monitor = create_security_monitor(config)

# Log authentication event
event_id = monitor.log_authentication_event(
    user_id="user@company.com",
    success=True,
    source_ip="192.168.1.100"
)

# Create audit trail
audit_id = monitor.create_audit_trail(
    user_id="admin@company.com",
    action="update_configuration",
    resource="/config/security",
    resource_type="configuration"
)
```

### Compliance Reporting
```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta
from src.observability.security import ComplianceFramework

# Generate SOC 2 compliance report
start_date = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=30)
end_date = datetime.now(timezone.utc)

report = monitor.generate_compliance_report(
    framework=ComplianceFramework.SOC2,
    start_date=start_date,
    end_date=end_date
)

print(f"Compliance Score: {report.compliance_score:.2%}")
print(f"Violations: {len(report.violations)}")
```
