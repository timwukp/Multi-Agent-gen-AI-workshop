- Data corruption resilience

**Key Features**:
- Simulated AWS service failures
- Network condition simulation
- Resource pressure testing
- Failure recovery validation
- Graceful degradation testing

## Test Architecture

### Mock Infrastructure

The testing suite uses comprehensive mocking to isolate components:

```python
# AWS Service Mocking
@patch('boto3.Session')
def test_with_mocked_aws(mock_session):
    mock_cloudwatch = Mock()
    mock_cloudwatch.list_metrics.return_value = {}
    mock_cloudwatch.put_metric_data.return_value = {"ResponseMetadata": {"HTTPStatusCode": 200}}
    mock_session.return_value.client.return_value = mock_cloudwatch
```

### Performance Benchmarking

Statistical analysis of performance metrics:

```python
class PerformanceBenchmark:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_statistics(measurements: List[float]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        return {
            "mean": statistics.mean(measurements),
            "median": statistics.median(measurements),
            "p95": sorted(measurements)[int(len(measurements) * 0.95)],
            "p99": sorted(measurements)[int(len(measurements) * 0.99)]
        }
```

### Chaos Engineering

Systematic failure injection:

```python
def intermittent_failure_put_metric_data(*args, **kwargs):
    nonlocal call_count
    call_count += 1
    if call_count % 3 == 0:  # Fail every 3rd call
        raise Exception("Intermittent CloudWatch failure")
    return {"ResponseMetadata": {"HTTPStatusCode": 200}}
```

## Test Execution

### Running Individual Test Categories

```bash
# Unit tests
pytest test_observability_unit_mocks.py -v

# Integration tests
pytest test_observability_integration_e2e.py -v

# Performance and chaos tests
pytest test_observability_performance_chaos.py -v

# Comprehensive suite
python test_observability_comprehensive.py
```

### Running Complete Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests with detailed reporting
python test_observability_runner.py

# Validate environment first
python validate_observability_tests.py
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Key performance metrics validated:

- **Tracing Overhead**: < 100% overhead for 1ms operations
- **Metrics Overhead**: < 200% overhead for metric collection
- **Memory Stability**: < 100MB increase during extended operations
- **Throughput**: > 100 operations/second under load
- **Concurrency**: Maintains performance at 50+ concurrent operations

## Security Considerations

The testing suite includes security validation:

- **Input Sanitization**: Tests for dangerous input handling
- **Attribute Filtering**: Validation of sensitive data filtering
- **Injection Prevention**: Tests for script and command injection
- **Access Control**: Validation of proper access patterns

## Conclusion

The comprehensive observability testing suite provides thorough validation of all observability components, ensuring production readiness through complete coverage, performance validation, resilience testing, security assurance, and integration verification.
