# Multi-Agent System Architecture Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-agent system architecture for Amazon finance research using Strands Agents SDK and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. The system demonstrates production-ready patterns for coordinated agent workflows with proper error handling, resilience, and AgentCore runtime integration.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Specialized Agent Classes

Created four specialized agent classes as required:

#### QueryRouterAgent (`src/agents/multi_agent_system.py`)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes user queries and routes to appropriate specialist agents
- **Features**: 
  - Query classification (stock analysis, news research, document search, comprehensive analysis)
  - Intent detection and routing decisions
  - JSON-structured routing responses with reasoning
- **Integration**: Uses BedrockModel with low temperature (0.1) for consistent routing

#### InternetResearchAgent (`src/agents/multi_agent_system.py`)
- **Purpose**: Searches for current Amazon news, stock data, and market information
- **Features**:
  - DuckDuckGo API integration via MCP (mock implementation for demo)
  - Credible source prioritization
  - Structured findings with source attribution
- **Integration**: Uses BedrockModel with moderate temperature (0.2) for varied search strategies

#### KnowledgeRetrievalAgent (`src/agents/multi_agent_system.py`)
- **Purpose**: Retrieves information from Bedrock Knowledge Base
- **Features**:
  - Enhanced Bedrock Knowledge Base integration
  - Document citation and relevance scoring
  - Historical financial data extraction
- **Integration**: Uses BedrockModel with low temperature (0.1) for factual retrieval

#### SummarizerAgent (`src/agents/multi_agent_system.py`)
- **Purpose**: Synthesizes findings from multiple agents into comprehensive reports
- **Features**:
  - Information synthesis across data sources
  - Executive summary generation
  - Actionable recommendations
- **Integration**: Uses BedrockModel with moderate temperature (0.3) for creative synthesis

### 2. Graph-Based Multi-Agent Coordination

#### ResilientFinanceGraph (`src/agents/finance_graph.py`)
- **Architecture**: Built using Strands GraphBuilder with proper node dependencies
- **Workflow**: Router → Research & Knowledge → Summarizer
- **Features**:
  - Error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff
  - State management through custom FinanceGraphState
  - Comprehensive result aggregation

#### Key Components:
- **Graph Building**: Uses Strands GraphBuilder with Agent nodes
- **Edge Configuration**: Sequential workflow with parallel research and knowledge retrieval
- **State Management**: Custom state tracking for query context and results
- **Error Resilience**: Retry mechanisms and fallback strategies

### 3. AgentCore Runtime Integration

#### Multi-Agent Entrypoint (`src/agentcore_app.py`)
- **Function**: `multi_agent_financial_analysis()`
- **Features**:
  - Mode selection (single vs multi-agent)
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Comprehensive response formatting
  - Execution time tracking

#### Async Task Processing
- **Function**: `process_multi_agent_analysis_async()`
- **Features**:
  - Background multi-agent processing
  - Streaming support preparation
  - Detailed execution metadata

#### Health Monitoring
- **Enhanced Health Checks**: Includes multi-agent system validation
- **Status Levels**: HEALTHY, HEALTHY_BUSY, UNHEALTHY based on component status
- **Monitoring**: Bedrock, Knowledge Base, Memory, and Multi-Agent system checks

## Technical Architecture

### Data Models

```python
@dataclass
class FinancialQuery:
    query: str
    user_id: Optional[str] = None
    session_id: Optional[str] = None
    query_type: Optional[str] = None
    parameters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None

@dataclass
class AgentResult:
    agent_name: str
    findings: str
    sources: List[str]
    execution_time_ms: int
    timestamp: str
    status: str
    error: Optional[str] = None

@dataclass
class FinancialAnalysisReport:
    query: FinancialQuery
    routing_decision: Dict[str, Any]
    agent_results: List[AgentResult]
    final_summary: str
    total_execution_time_ms: int
    agents_involved: List[str]
    timestamp: str
    status: str
```

### Workflow Execution

1. **Query Reception**: User query received via AgentCore entrypoint
2. **Query Routing**: QueryRouter analyzes and classifies the query
3. **Parallel Execution**: InternetResearch and KnowledgeRetrieval agents work in parallel
4. **Result Synthesis**: Summarizer combines findings into comprehensive report
5. **Response Delivery**: Structured response with metadata and execution details

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- **Individual Agent Tests**: Each agent class tested independently
- **Graph Coordination Tests**: Multi-agent workflow validation
- **AgentCore Integration Tests**: Runtime deployment and execution
- **Error Handling Tests**: Resilience and fallback mechanisms
- **Data Model Tests**: Structure and validation testing

### Test Results
- ✅ All individual agent tests passing

- ✅ Error handling and resilience mechanisms functional
- ✅ Input validation and security measures working

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Query Classification and Routing

- Fallback routing for edge cases

### 2. Parallel Agent Execution
- Concurrent execution of research and knowledge retrieval
- Proper state management across agents
- Result aggregation and synthesis

### 3. Error Handling and Resilience
